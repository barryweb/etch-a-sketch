- **Dynamic Grid Generation** – Creates a default 16×16 grid of square divs on page load
- **Fully Responsive** – Uses Flexbox layout and scales to any user-defined grid size(up to 100×100)
- **Custom Grid Size Input** – Prompt allows user to define grid size dynamically
- **RGB Hover Coloring** – Hovering over squares applies a random RGB background color
- **Reset Button** – Clears all colored squares and disables further coloring
- **All Grid Elements Created with JavaScript** – No hardcoded HTML grid

## TECH STACK USED
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox)

## NOTES
